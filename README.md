**MAD-WALLACE FRONT PAGE**

The task of Static Comp 1 was to build a responsive site that mimicked the layout and general stylings of the presented static comp. Below you will find photos of my re-creation and the presented static comp. The main theme of my comp is Mad Wallace, a band I'm currently in. We usually use a purple color pallette, which I used for this comp. In the header, there is a website title, description, and two buttons for Contact and Locate (the band). There are 7 sections, which would be links to other pages on the site. On the right side of the page, the aside has two options for scrolling through backround images (although no functionality in this comp): the top sort buttons and the two buttons on either side of the aside (styled as forward and rewind buttons). As you downsize the comp, the sections will eventually shift to where the aside disappears and only the header and section blocks take up the page. Then the blocks will start to line up in twos and finally stacked on top of each other one to one. In this last phase of responsiveness, the aside reappears as another section that would have the functionality of linking to another page.
